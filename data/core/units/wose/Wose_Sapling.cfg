    description= _ "The youngest of woses are called Saplings, and have not yet acquired their full strength. Although young compared to most woses, these Saplings are sometimes said be up to century old, and grow at much slower pace than most true trees. However, the true age at which a wose comes of age is not known by other races, and can only be speculated from rare encounters. Most Saplings are unable to properly defend themselves in armed combat, and like most woses they rarely seek out conflict, though their weak branches have the power to do some damage if they were attacked directly."
